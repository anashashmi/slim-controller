# Juliangut Slim Framework controller creator

Controller creator for Slim Framework.

Allows you to delegate objects creation for each route to the moment they are needed.

## Installation

Best way to install is to using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require juliangut/slim-controller
```

Then require_once the autoload file:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Usage

Provide any Slim map route with a closure generated by `Jgut\Slim\Controller\Closure`

```php
use Slim\Slim;
use Jgut\Slim\Controller\Closure;

$app = new Slim();
$app->get('hello/app', Closure::get('MyController:hello'));
$app->run();
```

In case you provided the application with a name you have to use it in closure creation as well

```php
$app = (new Slim())->setName('myApp');
$app->get('hello/app', Closure::create('MyController:hello', 'myApp'));
```

If your controller extends `Jgut\Slim\Controller\Controller` it is automatically provided with `getApplication()` method

```php
use Jgut\Slim\Controller\Controller;

class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function hello()
    {
        echo 'Hello ' . $this->getApplication()->getName();
    }
}
```
